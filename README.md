# mcdata

Experimental library for reading and writing Minecraft data files.

This implements the NBT (Named Binary Tags) and Anvil formats.

*NOTE!* This is a very early version. The API will probably change.

Requires Python 3.8.

A more complete library for reading NBT data: <https://github.com/twoolie/NBT/>

## Todo

* refer to "tag" as "tree"?

* error checking: raise exception if there are bytes left over after decoding.
